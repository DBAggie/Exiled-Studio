# Spike A: context

## Key files
- `tools/extractor/` (`loom-extractor`): where all Spike A code goes. Currently `src/main.rs` only.
- `crates/loom-data/`: core crate, empty. Not changed by Spike A (the canonical data schema is Phase 2).
- `Cargo.toml`: workspace lints (`unsafe_code = "deny"`, `unwrap_used`/`expect_used` warn, errors in CI).
- `.gitignore`: `/local/` and `/out/` are ignored; extractor output and PoB clones go in `local/`.
- `docs/spikes/`: holds `spike-c-legacy-oracle.md`; Spike A's report will be `docs/spikes/spike-a-extraction.md`.
- `docs/handoff/SUCCESSOR-HANDOFF.md`: Current state / Next action, updated every PR.

## ADRs that apply
- **ADR-005:** own Rust extractor; Bundles2 plus the community dat schema; PoB data is cross-check only; RePOE is the fallback; record game version, schema revision, and input hashes; maintainer-run; users get signed bundles only.
- **ADR-000:** derive data only; no GGG art or audio in the repo.
- **ADR-001/006:** the game is the truth; PoB v2.67.2 is the oracle for calcs; differences from PoB go in the divergence register.
- **ADR-011:** network only in integration adapters, so the schema is vendored, not fetched.
- **ADR-012:** small PRs with evidence.
- **ADR-014:** typed errors with stable codes; no `unwrap`/`expect` outside tests.
- **ADR-015:** never drop unresolved content silently; report it.
- **ADR-016:** core crates are wasm32-only; the extractor is a tool, not core, so it may use the filesystem.

## External references (verify license before using code or data)
- Community dat schema: `poe-tool-dev/dat-schema` on GitHub (GraphQL schema files; releases publish `schema.min.json` with `validFor` per game).
- Oodle-compatible decompression: `ooz` (C++, powzix) and Rust ports (for example the `oozextract` crate). Licenses not yet verified.
- Format write-ups and tools to consult (not copy): `poe-tool-dev/poe-dat-viewer`, LibGGPK3, PyPoE forks, RePOE (fallback input).
- Legacy PoB (read-only, never run git commands that write): `D:\POE Dev\PathOfBuilding`. Exporter: `src/Export/` (`spec.lua`, `Scripts/*.lua`, `ggpk/` uses `bun_extract_file.exe`). Exported data: `src/Data/`. For the cross-check, clone the public repo into `local/` instead.

## Findings so far (2026-11-08)
- PoE1 install: Steam app 238960, build 26474023. PoE2 install: Steam app 2694490, build 26476662. Read from `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\appmanifest_*.acf`.
- Both `Bundles2/` folders contain `_.index.bin`, `_.index.high.bin`, `_.index.low.bin`, `.index.dbg`. The purpose of the high/low/dbg files is unknown (step 1).
- PoB v2.67.2 (tag commit `b32759ab0`, 2026-08-08) data is the "3.29.2 Export" (`b383679a4`, 2026-08-06). A later "3.29.3 Export" (`1b4078dc4`, 2026-08-23) is on legacy HEAD. Latest tree version in PoB: `3_29`.
- PoB `src/Data/Bases/*.lua` is keyed by English display name, not the BaseItemTypes `Id`.
- `IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` Phase 2 item 4 ("converter from legacy exporter output to canonical bundles") predates revised ADR-005 and is stale. The ACTION-PLAN is authoritative. Tracked as a follow-up task in the tasks file.

## Decisions (with reasons)
- **Format code lives in `tools/extractor` (lib + bin), not in a core crate.** Extraction is maintainer-only (ADR-005); keeping it out of core avoids wasm and dependency constraints on spike code.
- **Parsers work on bytes; filesystem only at the edge.** CI can test without a game install (AGENTS.md test rules).
- **Decompressor behind a trait.** Framing tests use an identity decompressor; no GGG bytes in fixtures.
- **Vendor the pinned schema file** (license permitting) with tag, license notice, and hash. Reproducible, no network.
- **Outputs in `local/extract/<game>/<steam-build-id>/`** (AGENTS.md); commit only the report and a scrubbed manifest.
- **Spike output is plain deterministic JSON**, not the Phase 2 canonical bundle format.
- **`cargo-deny` before any third-party format dependency** (PR A1a), so the license gate is checked by CI, transitive dependencies included.
- **Cross-check reads a clone in `local/`,** never the legacy repo, which must not be written to (CLAUDE.md).

## Maintainer decisions (2026-11-08)
1. **PoE1 cross-check baseline:** use the newest PoB data export available, and search upstream for newer ones when A6 starts. As of 2026-11-08 the newest is the "3.29.3 Export" `1b4078dc4` (2026-08-23) in `PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding`. The installed build (Steam 26474023, November 2026) is probably newer, so remaining differences are categorized `patch-delta`. This is data cross-checking only; the calc oracle pin stays v2.67.2.
2. **Vendor the community schema file** into `tools/extractor/schema/` (license permitting): agreed.
3. **Dependency license policy:** only MIT-compatible permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, Zlib, Unlicense), enforced by `cargo-deny`. If only GPL decompressors exist, take the RePOE fallback: agreed.
4. **PoE2 cross-check:** check against the public `PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-PoE2` repo, cloned into `local/`, at its newest data export (search again at A6). As of 2026-11-08: "Export 0.5.5 data" `49e93925d` (2026-09-10). GitHub reports its license as `NOASSERTION`; we only read its data for comparison and copy nothing into this repo.
5. **Patch-delta ceiling N = 2%** of PoB keys per table: agreed.

These decisions are written into the ACTION-PLAN Spike A gate (2026-11-08).

## Open questions for the maintainer
None.

## Plan review (2026-11-08)
`plan-reviewer` verdict: proceed with changes. No ADR conflicts. Applied:
- Blockers: the cross-check uses a clone in `local/`, never the legacy repo; the PoE2 cross-check source became open question 4; fixed gap categories with tool evidence, `uncategorized = 0`, and an N% patch-delta ceiling.
- Should-fix: like-for-like keys (bases by English name, PoB-generated mods); output in `local/`; `cargo-deny` PR before dependencies; ignored install-backed decompression test; shuffled-input determinism test, `BTreeMap` only, dirty-tree flag; `indexing_slicing` lint and corrupt-input property tests; gap list feeds the divergence register.
- Nits: schema license notice and hash over committed bytes; A4 may split; A5 can run in parallel; the stale IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN item is a tracked task; survey existing Rust crates first (may collapse A1-A3).
